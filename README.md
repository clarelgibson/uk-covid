# COVID-19 UK Data

## Project Outline
This project serves to answer the question **"How does 2021 compare with 2020 in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths?"** The two years of the pandemic have taken very different approaches to dealing with the virus, with national lockdowns the focus of 2020 and vaccination the focus of 2021. As we approach the winter season in 2021, this project aims to assess what impact the different strategies are having on the three metrics and whether our current strategy will be enough to avoid future social restrictions.

## Data
